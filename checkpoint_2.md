### Checkpoint 2 Update

#### Accomplished goals:

- User Creation
- Login / Logout
- Session persistence
- User can upload a song

We now have full user management. The session was changed to use JWTs. 
All goals from the previous sprint that did not get finished are now 
complete, with the exception of purchasing a domain. 

#### Goals we didn't hit:
  - Upload song into 15 second snippet.

Reasons we didn't hit our goals:
  - Splitting a mp4 file into a song snippet is really hard.
